#### Long Answer Questions
1. If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, then find the maximum value of $a^m b^n$ for $m, n \geq 0$ and $m + n = 4$, and prove that your answer is indeed the maximum value.

2. Let $P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ be a cubic polynomial with real coefficients such that $P(0) = -1$, $P(1) = 0$, and $P(-1) = 2$. Find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and then factorize the given polynomial.

3. A line $L$ is parallel to the line $3x + 4y + 5 = 0$. Find the equation of the line $L$ that passes through the point $(1, 2)$ and is at a distance of $3$ units from the line $3x + 4y + 20 = 0$.

4. In a triangle $ABC$, it is given that the length of the medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are $7$, $9$, and $11$ respectively. Find the lengths of the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ of the triangle.

5. Let $f(x)$ be a real-valued function defined on the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $f(x) + f(1 - x) = 1$ for all $x$ in $[0, 1]$. Find the value of $\int_0^1 f(x) dx$.

6. If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are real numbers such that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ and $x + y + z = 0$, find the maximum value of $xy + yz + zx$ and prove that your answer is indeed the maximum value.
